# Wireless Mobile Subscriber Churn Prediction Model & Generative AI Chatbot

**Break Through Tech AI Studio Project** - Verizon Team #2

**Authors** - Ria Kundu, Rachel Chan, Ami Rajesh, Meghana Killada, David Wang

**Overview**
- Built a supervised ML/DNN model that predicts the churn of wireless mobile subscribers using network location, network usage (voice / data), billing and customer service data.
- Created a generative AI/BI (RAG to SQL) chatbot to help answer natural language analytic queries on the predicted dataset.

**Technologies** - Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, OpenAI API, ChromaDB, HuggingFace, SQLite, Streamlit, Github, Google Drive (Colab, Docs, Slides)
